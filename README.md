# Eventmanagement-system-for-college_Project

The event management system project for college is designed to streamline and automate the process of managing and organizing events within a college or university setting. The system includes various fields to capture and store relevant information about the events and participants. The fields typically include:

1. Name: This field captures the name of the participant involved in the event. It helps in identifying individuals and their roles in the system.

2. Email: This field is used to collect the email addresses of participants . It serves as a means of communication and enables sending event-related updates, notifications, and confirmations.

3. Year: This field is used to record the academic year or class level of the participant. It helps in organizing events specific to certain groups or ensuring eligibility for participation.

4. Event Name: This field captures the name or title of the event being organized. It helps in distinguishing between different events and allows for easy reference and search.
